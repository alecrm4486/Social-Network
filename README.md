# Social-Network
this is an small project on Social Networks. 
In this project I use the database of Arxiv ASTRO-PH (Astro Physics) collaboration network to analyze their properties. 
Scientific networks are characterized by high influence of authorsâ€™ reputation in writing collaborative articles, 
This means that high reputed professors often collab- orated with few circle of researchers forming, in this way, clusters among the network.
